"""
This module   REVISITS  the simple   Line   class that you implemented 
previously.  Note that:
  1. This is NOT rosegraphics -- it is your OWN Line class.
  2. We supply (below) a Point class that you should use in implementing
       your Line class.  YOU will implement PART of the Point class.

The learning objective of this exercise is to review QUICKLY the key ideas
of implementing classes, by RE-DOING work that you did previously, but doing
it in a BETTER way, by following along with your instructor.

The KEY IDEAS are:
  1. The notation for implementing a class called (say) Blah is:
        class Blah:
            def __init__(self, ...):
                ...
            def other_methods(self, ...):
                ...
                     
  2. When one constructs an instance of class Blah, e.g.:
            b = Blah(...)
     ** the  __init__  method in Blah's class definition runs, **
     with   self   referring to a NEW place in memory for
         ** Blah object being constructed **
     and the remaining arguments referring to the values in the parentheses.
     
  3. When one calls a method on an instance of class Blah, e.g.:
            b.other_method(...)
     the   other_method   method in Blah's class definition runs,
     with   self   referring to
         ** the object in front of the DOT **
     and the remaining arguments referring to the values in the parentheses.
  
  4. INSIDE a class definition, one uses exactly the SAME NOTATION as one uses
     OUTSIDE a class definition.  For example, inside the Blah class,
     one constructs a Blah object by:   b = Blah(...)
     
     Just remember that SELF refers to an instance of the class being defined. 

  5. If an instance of the class needs to REMEMBER (store) information in
     order for you to implement a method, add YOUR OWN instance variable
     for that purpose to __init__.  Choose a meaningful name for it, then
     use that instance variable as needed in other methods.
